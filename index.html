        This is a game based on Wordle, but each day has its own twist rather than its own answer.<br>
        You can play the game more than once on the same day, and you are almost gauranteed to get a different answer, but the twist is the same.<br>
        Can you figure out each day's twist? Some of them may be based on other Wordle-inspired games.
        The hint button will present a normal Wordle where the answer is the five-letter hint for the twist.<br>
        You can play any day's twist, or you can specify the associated word (i.e. the hint) to play that twist.<br>
